Project Title: Image Classification of Cats and Dogs Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Overview: This project shows how to identify photos of dogs and kittens using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can reliably recognize and categorize photos based on their content (either a dog or a cat) by utilizing a dataset from the Kaggle "Dogs vs. Cats" competition.

Dataset: The "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, which is accessible on Kaggle, was used in this study. It is a good option for training image classification models because it includes thousands of captioned photos of dogs and cats. Images of different sizes are included in the dataset; these must be processed and downsized before being entered into the machine learning method.
